This project analyzes crime rates across various states using the provided dataset, `crime_by_districts.csv`. 
It offers insights into trends and patterns in crime occurrences, aiming to inform decision-making and policy formulation.

About the Dataset:
The `crime_by_districts.csv` dataset includes data on crime rates segmented by state, potentially covering various crime categories and yearly records. Each row represents a specific instance (e.g., a state in a particular year), and columns detail crime statistics and possibly other relevant demographic or geographical information.
Key columns (if known):
- **State**: The name of the state where the data was recorded.
- **Year**: The year the data applies to.
- **Crime Type(s)**: Categories of crime (e.g., violent crime, property crime).
- **Crime Count/Rate**: Specific counts or rates for each crime type.

The project aims to:
1. Understand crime distribution across states.
2. Identify any significant trends over time.
3. Visualize crime data to highlight areas needing policy focus or resource allocation.
   
The datasets contain the following information:
Rows: 9,841 ; 
Columns: 13 ; 
Key columns include STATE/UT, Year, and various crime types (e.g., Murder, Assault on women, Kidnapping and Abduction) with an additional DISTRICT column for more granular data.

These insights and KPIs can guide our dashboard design, helping users explore crime trends, compare regions, and gain a deeper understanding of crime data across different dimensions.
